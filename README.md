# `PDiagrams`

Making diagrams is a hard and time-consuming process. Trust me, I've made a lot of bad diagrams during my PhD, but every now and then, I managed to make a half-decent one. This repository is my personal collection of those "half-decent" diagrams that I have used in various publications and talks, all created using Adobe Illustrator. I was lucky that Brown University provided an Adobe Illustrator license, which made creating them possible. However, since Adobe Illustrator isn't open source and can be expensive, I wanted to make these diagrams publicly available.

You are free to download, modify, and reuse these diagrams for your own purposes. My hope is that they might save someone time or serve as a helpful starting point.


## Contents

All diagrams are available as vector-based `.pdf` files, which preserve high resolution and allow for easy modification in vector graphics software. Hereâ€™s how I organized the directories:

- `coalescent-theory/`: Diagrams illustrating coalescent theory concepts and models.
- `human-evolution/`: Diagrams of human evolutionary history and processes.
- `introgression/`: Diagrams detailing the instantaneous unidirectional admixture model.
- `muc19/`: Diagrams from [Villanea and Peede et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.25.559202).

## Usage

You are welcome and encouraged to download, modify, and reuse these diagrams! To make these diagrams as freely available as possible, they have been dedicated to the public domain using the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
